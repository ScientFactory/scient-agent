# Scient Agent: maintainer guide

Scient Agent is the native research agent of [Scient](https://github.com/ScientFactory/scient-desktop). It is built from [Oh My Pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) (OMP): it inherits OMP's agent runtime whole and changes what makes it a separate product. A machine can run Scient Agent and a stock `omp` side by side without either reading, changing, or updating the other.

`scient.json` records the product version and the exact upstream release this tree derives from.

## What Scient changes

Everything else is upstream's code and behavior.

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Name | The executable is `scient-agent`, and shell profile aliases run it. `--version` prints `scient-agent/<version>`; `--runtime-info` prints a JSON description (product, version, upstream release and commit, RPC versions, build id) for hosts. Process titles, log files and Windows named pipes carry the name. |
| Wording | The agent calls itself Scient Agent, and its command `scient-agent`, wherever a person or a model reads its words: messages, help, sign-in instructions, prompts, the built-in documentation, window and notification titles. `scripts/scient/rename-wording.ts` generates this. |
| State | The config root is `~/.scient-agent` (project folder `.scient-agent/`), or the absolute directory a host sets in `SCIENT_AGENT_ROOT`. User config lookups, the native addon cache, browser storage state and crash logs follow it. A host's root is authoritative: `SCIENT_AGENT_DIR` is ignored under it, and a `.env` in the project or the home directory cannot set any `SCIENT_AGENT_*` variable (a `.env` inside the root can). The root is taken only from the launch environment, never from a `.env`. Standalone use keeps upstream's `.env` overrides. |
| Variables | The variables that choose where state lives have `SCIENT_AGENT_*` names: `CONFIG_DIR`, `CONFIG_FILES`, `DIR`, `PROFILE`, `SESSION_DIR`, `WORKTREE_DIR`, `AUTH_BROKER_*`, the cache database overrides, and the runtime directory, socket and configuration variables the agent hands its own workers. OMP's names for them are ignored. Tuning variables (`PI_*`) are unchanged. |
| Native addon cache | A compiled binary extracts its addon into a directory named for the addon's content, so two builds on one upstream version never load each other's, and it loads only that addon: an addon found beside the executable is not a fallback. |
| Symbol | The sign-in page every browser sign-in ends on and the `stats` dashboard show Scient Agent's symbol (`packages/utils/src/brand/scient-agent-symbol.svg`, the file Scient Desktop shows for the agent; copy it over when the symbol changes) in Scient's colors. |
| Tiny model worker | Its launch tag carries the product version, not the upstream package version, so a new Scient Agent release replaces a worker an earlier release left running. |
| Updates | `scient-agent update` only updates plugins. The startup update check and the startup marketplace refresh are off. A host or installer replaces the executable. |
| Reporting | Automatic tool-issue reports to OMP's service are off by default. |
| Browser relay | The relay listens on port 9324 (OMP uses 9224), so each product runs its own. |
| Sign-ins | Over RPC the agent starts without a model (a host signs in and picks one afterwards; a model named with `--model` that cannot be resolved still ends the run). `get_login_providers` also reports each entry's `kind` (`account` or `key`) whether a sign-in is `stored`, and the `store` it is kept under: two entries with one `store` are two ways to sign in to one account and share status and sign-out. `logout` removes an entry's stored sign-ins and fails when the store still holds them afterwards. When the active credential store is an auth broker's snapshot (`credentials.heldByBroker`), the broker owns the sign-ins: they are listed as not stored and `logout` is refused. `set_model` re-reads the sign-in store before it reports a model as missing, so a session that was already running finds a sign-in completed in another process. It re-reads the store and runs the sign-in hooks again (`ModelRegistry.reapplySignInProjections`), and rediscovers that provider's models only when the session holds no discovered catalog for it. No static reload runs, so nothing that was usable is lost. A model that only a second account of an already discovered provider has is still reported missing until the session restarts. |

Left as upstream, on purpose:

- Internal package names (`@oh-my-pi/*`) and package versions. The native addon is stamped with and checked against the package version.
- The `omp://` internal URL scheme, the `.omp-plugin` marketplace format, the `${OMP_PLUGIN_ROOT}` substitution and the `omp` key in a plugin's `package.json`: these are formats plugins are written against.
- Which configuration is discovered. Another agent's folder in the home directory (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, ...) is read only when `enabledProviders` names it; the same folders in a project are read, as upstream does. Scient Agent does not read `.omp` anywhere.
- Model discovery. On startup the agent refreshes the model catalog from `catalog.stencil.so` (cached, conditional, falls back to the bundled list) and asks several model providers for their public model lists.
- `share`, `collab`, `stream` and the skill registry still default to OMP's services. They run only on an explicit command.
- Provider sign-in routes and their request headers.
- Native sign-in helper state stays under `~/.scient-agent/oauth` even when a host assigns a root. A URL-scheme handler is registered once per user, and that folder holds the lease that keeps two agent processes from registering it at once. OMP uses the same URL schemes with its own lease, so on macOS and Linux Scient Agent refuses to start a sign-in while an OMP sign-in helper holds the scheme, and checks again just before it registers its own. The two products cannot fully exclude each other: a stock `omp` does not know Scient Agent's helper, so starting the same vendor's sign-in in both at once can make one of the two attempts fail. Windows has no such check yet.
- What the agent calls itself to another program or service: the `originator` and the `User-Agent` that some provider requests carry, the terminal handshake, Warp's agent name. These are part of how a service recognizes the client.
- The line a background process of the agent prints when it is ready (`omp lsp mux listening on ...`). The pattern that waits for it is saved with the process's record, so a later build must print what an earlier build waits for.
- The message that says Oh My Pi holds a sign-in link: it is about the other product.
- Benchmark tooling (`packages/metaharness`, `packages/typescript-edit-benchmark`) and the sentence about RoboOMP, upstream's issue bot: there `omp` is the agent they run.
- The terminal interface's π logo and icon: the symbol has no terminal drawing yet. Scient drives the agent over RPC, where neither shows.
- The built-in welcome image, changelogs and READMEs, and the names of tuning variables (`PI_*`, `OMP_*`) where the documentation mentions them.

## Branches, releases and upstream updates

- `main` holds Scient Agent. Changes reach it through pull requests that keep their commits (rebase merge; history stays linear). A release is a `v<version>` tag on `main` that matches `scient.json`: `v0.1.0`, `v0.1.1`, ...
- Scient's commits come in three kinds: the scripts under `scripts/scient/`, generated commits (the output of `rename-identity.ts` or `rename-wording.ts` and nothing else, subject ending in `(generated)`), and hand-written changes. A pull request that changes what a script produces carries the output as its own `(generated)` commit.
- `upstream` is a fetch-only remote for Oh My Pi. `scient/18.4.8` is the branch the work started on, kept as it was.

Taking a newer Oh My Pi release is one pull request. Scient's work is replayed onto the new release, generated commits are regenerated rather than replayed, and the result replaces `main`'s tree:

```sh
git fetch --no-tags upstream "refs/tags/v<new>:refs/upstream-tags/v<new>"
git switch -c omp-sync/v<new> refs/upstream-tags/v<new>
git cherry-pick <the commits that add the scripts>
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun scripts/scient/rename-identity.ts      # commit the result as "(generated)"
git cherry-pick <each hand-written commit, in order>
bun scripts/scient/rename-wording.ts       # commit the result as "(generated)"
# update scient.json, run the checks, then:
git tag omp-sync/v<new>                    # keeps the replayed commits for the next update
git switch -c sync/omp-v<new> main
git read-tree -u --reset omp-sync/v<new>
git commit -m "sync: Oh My Pi <new>"       # open the pull request from this branch
```

The commits to replay are the Scient commits of the last `omp-sync/*` tag (or of `scient/18.4.8` before the first update) followed by the commits on `main` after its last `sync:` commit, leaving out generated ones. `rename-wording.ts` stops when a text it lists by hand is no longer in the source; look at what upstream did with it and fix the list.

## Build

Needs Bun 1.4 or newer, `rustup` (the toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` installs itself), CMake and Ninja.

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build:native                          # Rust addon for this machine
bun --cwd=packages/coding-agent run build     # packages/coding-agent/dist/scient-agent
```

## Checks

```sh
bun scripts/scient/rename-identity.ts --check   # no OMP state name is left in the source
bun scripts/scient/rename-wording.ts --check    # the agent's words name Scient Agent
bun run check:ts
bun --cwd=packages/utils test
bun --cwd=packages/natives test
bun scripts/scient/isolation-check.ts packages/coding-agent/dist/scient-agent
```

`isolation-check.ts` starts the built binary in empty home directories, with every OMP state variable pointing at a decoy and a proxy recording what it tries to reach. It fails if the agent writes its own state outside its config root, follows one of OMP's variables, touches an OMP home, hands its shell a variable that would steer a stock `omp`, or contacts an OMP service or update source unasked. It prints the hosts contacted. It does not limit what a task may write or reach.

It runs without a model, so it covers startup, the RPC handshake and the agent's shell. Scient Desktop's live suites (`OMP_QUALIFY_TARGET=scient`) cover model turns, subagents, background work and sessions against the same executable.

Upstream's tests are rewritten together with the wording they expect. The rest of upstream's suite is not part of Scient's checks yet: some of its tests assert behavior Scient changed on purpose (state locations, updates, the startup checks).

## Release

`.github/workflows/scient.yml` builds and checks every platform on every push to `main` and on every pull request into it: macOS (Apple silicon and Intel), Linux (x86-64 and ARM64, glibc) and Windows (x86-64 and ARM64), each on its own GitHub-hosted runner, each with the isolation check. On x86-64 the binary carries the `modern` (AVX2) and `baseline` native addons (`PI_NATIVE_X64_VARIANT` builds each). Pushing a `v<version>` tag that matches `scient.json` also signs and notarizes the macOS builds and drafts a GitHub release with every binary and its SHA-256. A person publishes the draft. Not built yet: Linux with musl (Alpine). The Windows builds are not code-signed.

Signing uses the same five repository secrets, in the same form, as Scient Desktop's release: `CSC_LINK` (the Developer ID Application certificate as a base64 `.p12`), `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_API_KEY` (the App Store Connect `.p8` key's text), `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` and `APPLE_API_ISSUER`.
